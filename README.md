# Question as a starting point:

1) What question(s) am I trying to answer? Do I think the data collected can answer that question?

2) What is the best way to phrase my question(s) as a machine learning problem?

3) Have I collected enough data to represent the problem I want to solve?

4) What features of the data did I extract, and will these enable the right predictions?

5) How will I measure success in my application?

6) How will the machine learning solution interact with other parts of my research or business product?

# Question for Algorithms  

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/data-science-for-beginners-the-5-questions-data-science-answers 

1) Is this A or B ? => Classification algorithms ( two-class or multiclass clasification) 
2) Is this weird or not normal ? => Anomaly detection algorithms  
3) How much or how many ? => Regression algorithms (continuous data)
4) How this is organized ? => Clustering algorithms (Which viewers like the same types of movies?)  
5) What should I do now ? => Reinforcement learning algorithms (Decision process and rewards system , e.g: autonomous driving)  


# Model interaction

1) Define the interaction with the data science models: REST?   RPC calls RabbitMQ?    Kafka Message Bus?
2) Plan to use notebooks (Jupyther, Azure Notebook, Google colab)
